Speech Recognition Neural Network

I'm building a neural network to recognize oral speech and put it to text form. The input to this neural network will be digitized audio data. The neural network will output those spoken words as text. This is my first every neural network, so I'm trying to really just dive in and learn as I go. This is a learning experience and I hope to get it to work with not just english in American accents but hopefull speech in other accents as well. My parents are Yoruba and migrated from Nigeria and have accents. I want my neural network to be able to decipher their speech just as well as mine, having grown up all my life in America.
